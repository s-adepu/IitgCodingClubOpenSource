## C++ code to find sum of ACSII value of your fullname :-

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    // A program to find sum of ascii values of your input
    string name; // variable to store name
    int ascii_sum = 0; // variable to store sum of ascii chatrecters
    cout<<"Enter full name(case sensitive) :- ";
    getline(cin,name);
    for(int i = 0; i < name.length(); i++)
    {
        if(name[i] != ' ')
        {
            ascii_sum += int(name[i]); 
        }
    }
    cout<<"Sum of ASCII values of full name is "<<ascii_sum<<endl;
    return 0;
}

// Sample input : Enter full name(case sensitive) :- Adepu Sriharsha Shashank                                                                                   
// Output Sum of ASCII values of full name is 2245
